# Recruitment Platform
This is a project I've been working on to test out Dapper with .net Web APIs to create a simple Recruitment platform.
The idea is you the platform will let you manage position on external job boards (such as SEEK & Indeed) as well as your own website. 

## Frontend
The frontend framework used is Angular 16, and  Bootstrap is used for quick & easy styling.

## Backend
The Backend is .net Web APIs with Dapper ORM, and SQL Server. 


## Future Plans
- Using AWS Congnito for user authentication.
- Implememt .net data annotations library for backend data validation.
- Add a simple migration syste, should it become necessary.
